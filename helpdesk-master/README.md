The user is presented with two directories to search from in the form of two raio buttons.

Upon selection of a radio button the user is presented with a list of current tickets held on file.
Each listing has a set of three buttons which relate to that ticket.

Three buttons are: 'View more details', 'Edit' and 'Delete'
